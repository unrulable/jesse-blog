In the era of digital autonomy, the choice to use your own modem and router becomes more than a matter of convenience – it's a statement of independence. In this post, I'll unravel the reasoning behind my decision to liberate myself from the shackles of rented equipment and explore the steps I took to embrace control over my internet setup.

# Why Use Your Own Modem and Router?
## Cost-Efficiency
Paying a monthly fee for a rented modem is not just an inconvenience; it's a drain on your wallet. Currently, I shell out $5 per month, totaling $60 annually. By investing in a quality modem upfront (around $120), I not only break free from recurring charges but also own a reliable device for its entire lifespan.

## Tailored Efficiency
Opting for your own modem allows you to tailor your hardware to match your internet usage and needs precisely. Unlike ISP-provided modems, which prioritize cost efficiency and control, choosing your own ensures you get the most out of your equipment, unhindered by corporate constraints.

## VPN Integration
For those who prioritize privacy, implementing a comprehensive VPN strategy is crucial. Rather than wrestling with limitations on individual devices, I've decided to integrate VPN directly into my router. This way, all connections passing through the router benefit from the added layer of security.

# Modem Setup
1. **Plug in the New Modem**
2. **Navigate to [spectrum.net/selfinstall](spectrum.net/selfinstall)**
    - You may be redirected to activate.spectrum.net.
3. **Activate Your Device**
    - *Note: If you already have a registered modem, select the option to replace your modem.*

# Router Setup
Equipped with an Asus AC5300 gaming-style router, swapping out my Spectrum Router required a seamless setup process. I opted for the Asus app, which provides a straightforward walkthrough, guiding users through the process effortlessly.

*Note: Alternatively, use a LAN cable to connect directly from the router to your computer and navigate to router.asus.com for setup.*

# Configurations (VPN, etc.)
**VPN Integration**
    I'm exploring VPN options that align with high privacy standards and accept Bitcoin as payment. Considerations include:
    - CyberGhostVPN
    - ExpressVPN
    - Private Internet Access (PIA)

# Outro: Embrace Digital Independence
Embrace control over your internet experience – liberate yourself from rented equipment, and set up your own modem and router. It's not just a choice; it's a step towards digital independence. By taking charge of your hardware and security configurations, you're not just saving costs but ensuring a personalized, efficient, and private online experience. As you navigate this digital landscape, remember: your internet, your rules.

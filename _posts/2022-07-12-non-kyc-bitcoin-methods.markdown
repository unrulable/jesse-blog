# Intro
### KYC Brief Overview
KYC aka **K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer or **K**now **Y**our **C**lient, is a standard used by financial institutions designed to protect against fraud, corruption, money laundering, and "terrorist financing".

Here is a full [article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp) on KYC. I'd suggest reading through this if you want the full details, but in general, just know that when you purchase or sell from financial exchanges that require you go through the KYC process, you're handing over your:
- Full Name
- Address
- SSN
- Picture of your face

Once they have your data, you're at their mercy to properly secure and protect your data. You have a greater risk of malicious entities stealing your data, your data being sold, or your data being monitored and used for activities that you don't agree with at any point from here until eternity. The Bitcoin blockchain is immutable forever, so transactions you make today could be analyzed, judged, and in a worst case scenario prosecuted for reasons instituted by future governments. We can't predict the future and we can't control the continual privacy intrusions and theft of rights that these governments may try to implement.

KYC feeds the surveillance state. KYC is anti-Bitcoin.

### About this Post
In the content below, I outline the items, applications, and methods that I've personally used to acquire non-KYC Bitcoin or am in the process of completing, but by no means are these the only ways to of accomplishing this. As always, do your own research. 

Alright let's get to fighting against the surveillance state.

# Bitcoin ASIC Mining
## Overview

ASIC mining is the act of mining Bitcoin using a specialized computer device called an **A**pplication **S**pecific **I**ntegrated **C**ircuit miner; it does one thing and one thing only, **IT MINES BITCOIN**.

More specifically, the ASIC miner is designed to mine using a [proof of work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work) algorithm called [SHA-256](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html), which is the [cryptographic hash algorithm](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cryptographic-hash-functions/) that the Bitcoin network utilizes. Miners complete cryptographic tasks to process transactions for the Bitcoin network and for doing so, they are rewarded in bitcoin.

Mining is an excellent way to acquire bitcoin due to the fact that, at a basic level, it's an extremely easy setup process, you simply need the proper electricity to power the miner and access to the internet; no KYC required. You'll be up and running in less than a day from my experience and will immediately start acquiring non-KYC Bitcoin.

## How to get started
### Resources
Firstly, I strongly suggest reading both of these guides below. They are phenomenal resources on the topic of how to start home Bitcoin mining correctly, while also keeping security and privacy at the forefront.
- [Mining for the Streets](https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/)
- [Home mining for non-KYC Bitcoin](https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/home-mining-for-non-kyc-bitcoin)

### Prepare Environment
Before you spend a cent on a physical Bitcoin ASIC miner, prepare your environment for your new mining setup. The last thing you want to do is ruin your ASIC miner/s or even worse, start an electrical fire because your home's electrical setup didn't meet the minimum requirements to be running an ASIC miner.
- Electrical infrastructure setup. You'll need at least a 220 volt outlet so have the required electricity and components installed.
  - I'm currently having a home built and am having 220 volt outlets installed for my home mining setup, so I'll try to document that process as well.
  *Note: depending on how many miners you plan to run, your electricity needs will obviously vary based on that factor so verify your math or have a licensed electrician assist you so you don't fuck this critical part up.*
- Determine how you'll handle the ASIC miner effects as it is loud AF and hotter than the devil's dick.
  - Options
    - Build a box that will house your Bitcoin ASIC miner, thus reducing sound decibels and allowing for the heat to be properly vented through the ducting. Below are good options for both DIY and prebuilt manufactured boxes.
      - DIY
        - [DIY Soundproof Enclosure](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cloh76/building-a-soundproof-enclosure-for-my-bitmain-s9-bitcoin-antminer-my-building-journey-video-included)

        - [Lite Sound Box](https://litesoundbox.com/collections/all)
    - Immersion mining is a cooling method used to submerse your ASIC miner in a non-conductive liquid. This technique will eliminate both noise and heat from the environment, but requires a somewhat complex setup of circulation pumps and tanks to properly circulate and cool the liquid to disperse the heat efficiently. Don't let that deter you though, just research the topic, get the supplies, and get to work!

      *This is my newest venture, I'll do my best to document my failures... and wins hopefully :)*

### Buy ASIC Miner

***Note:*** *There are many other sources that you can purchase ASIC miners from but I can't confirm the legitimacy of those sources so I'm not going to mention them.*

Below are the marketplaces that I've successfully purchased Bitcoin ASIC miners without any issues. 
- [KaboomRacks](https://t.me/s/kaboomracks)
- [NewEgg](https://www.newegg.com/)

Specifically, I purchased two of the [Bitmain Antminer S9J](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s9j-14-5th) models. The first one I paid $480.00 and the second one I paid $390.00, both miners came with a Antminer APW7 **P**ower **S**upply **U**nit so I didn't need to purchase anything additional. 

![My Antminer S9J](/img/antminers9j.jpg)

The reason the price decreased between the two purchases was that I purchased the first miner when the bitcoin price was at $45K and by the time I purchased the second miner the bitcoin price had dropped to about $27K levels. This is a great example to illustrate how these ASIC miners value is currently directly correlated with the bitcoin price, [difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty), and overall mining competition as all of these combined will impact the profitability, but luckily for me, I don't give a shit about the profitability. This venture is solely about acquiring non-KYC so let's keep on keepin on.

### Select a Mining Pool
***Note:*** *I'll only be covering the mining pools that I've personally used but there are MANY to choose from.*

#### Overview
A mining pool is a group of individual miners that combine their computational resources to mine bitcoin. Alone the individual miner may have a low [hash rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) but when you combine that with the hash rate of a thousand other miners then together you'll be mining some serious bitcoin. You'll be rewarded bitcoin in proportion to the amount of hashing power you are contributing to the pool, so make sure you are aware of the mining pool's rewards, payouts, and fees to determine which one is the right fit for your mining setup.

#### Options
- [Slush Pool](https://slushpool.com/en/home/)
- [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/asic-mining)
  - While not exactly a mining pool, you are still rewarded in bitcoin for providing your hashing power to the NiceHash service. NiceHash acts like a broker to sell the hashing power that you're providing to hash power buyers.

# P2P Exchanges
All of these options below are decentralized peer to peer exchanges that I have personally bought bitcoin from. 

## Overview
In general, decentralized P2P exchanges have many advantages such as, no single point of failure, no single point of control, and no single point of regulation. You're trading/swapping directly with your peers, there is no centralized third party involved. You don't need to create an account with the exchange and you don't need to transfer your money/assets to the exchange, so there's no risk of your data and/or funds being stolen by malicious entities.

## Options
- [Bisq](https://bisq.network/)
  - Decentralized
  - Non-Custodial
  - Tor by default
  - No-KYC

  ***Note:*** *This is a big one... Bisq requires a security deposit in bitcoin. This helps deter malicious entities from attempting to defraud Bisq's users but also can be seen as a deterrent due to the fact that you first need to be in possession of some bitcoin before you can buy some bitcoin.*

- [RoboSats](http://robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion)
  - Decentralized
  - Non-Custodial
  - No-KYC
  - Requires [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to use full functionality

# Coin Mixing
I want to mention coin mixing as this should be done by any privacy conscious Bitcoiner. This technique creates it exponentially more difficult to track your transactions and further helps preserve your privacy.

***Note:*** *Mixing your bitcoin can essentially flag your bitcoin as "tainted", so if you ever attempted to sell it on a centralized exchange you may be denied service. The centralized exchanges accomplish this by analyzing and determining if any of the bitcoin you've sent into the exchange is linked to any addresses associated with coin mixing. Moral of the story, don't ever sell your bitcoin :)*

## Overview
In my laments terms, coin mixing is the technique of:
- Pooling your bitcoin with other peers
- Mixing your coins together using magical techniques that the coin mixing service performs 
- bitcoin are sent back out at random amounts to eventually equal the original amount you sent in 

![Coin Mixer Example](/img/CoinJoinExample.jpg)

## Mixing Services
- [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver)
- [Whirlpool](https://samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool)

***Note:*** *It's critical that you use your OWN Bitcoin node when performing coin mixes, if you don't then your wallet and transactions are not private. When connecting to a public Bitcoin node, you have absolutely no idea who you're connecting too; it could be a government's bitcoin node that they're using to monitor its citizens.*

# TODO
- Bitcoin ATMs
  - I need to go to a Bitcoin ATM, I'll update the post after I complete this...

# Wrapping Up
You can **NEVER** un-KYC yourself so be extremely cautious about who you hand over your data to.

Take steps now to secure your future and put yourself on the path of privacy and security because...

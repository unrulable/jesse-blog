# Intro
This post is a short post on my exposure to Bitcoin and how I evolved from price obsession to Bitcoin enthusiast.
<br/>
# Blinded by the Price
Bitcoin is freedom, but unfortunately most people that know about Bitcoin miss this point completely. They're only aware about the price of bitcoin, what they hear about it on the evening news, or how they should hurry and buy more before it goes to 1 million USD per bitcoin ([FOMO](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fomo)). It's only until you take a step back and awaken from the price fallacy, that you'll come to the realization that the Bitcoin network itself is an uncensorable and unstoppable force.

I fell into this category of price obsession. Back in late 2016 I made my first bitcoin transaction, here's how I acted:
- I was obsessed about the bitcoin price "going to the moon".

  <br/>
- I would check the price constantly!

  <br/>
- I would buy bitcoin on any centralized crypto exchanges handing out my identity to pretty much whoever wanted it.

<br/>
Looking back, I feel foolish for behaving like this but I just didn't fully grasp what Bitcoin even was until about a year into it so I guess I'll take it as a learning experience ha...
<br/>
# My Price Enlightenment
### Read the Whitepaper
I awoke from this price obsession after actually taking the time to sit down and read the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). This completely changed my life, as I came to the realization that Bitcoin is not just another investment opportunity, but it's a freedom network for the people.

I was completely hooked and it sparked a fire inside me that drove me to researching the issues with traditional banking and how we're being used by the system. Bitcoin aims to solve the problems that are currently plaguing us, below I list out these issues that I see and how Bitcoin can help solve these issues while at the same time providing complete autonomy for the individual utilizing it.

<br/>
# Traditional Banking Issues
### Accessibility
Banking systems are only online for a specific number of days and hours during the week. If you need to send money when the bank is not open then you'll be SOL.

### Censorship
In theory, if you think or act the wrong way that is against the current accepted narrative that is being spread by the banks, government, media, etc. then you are at risk. Both the banks and federal government have the ability to freeze your bank accounts if you step out of line. A recent example of this was the Canadian Trucker Protest where anyone who supported the anti-mandate protest was subject to having their bank accounts frozen; article [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385).

### Data Collection
More surveillance capitalism here. Banks collect and sell your data to 3rd party companies, specifically your credit and debit card activity, so where you shop, how you pay, and what time of day that you go shopping are all being sold to these companies; article [here](https://mysudo.com/2021/03/shocked-or-not-your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/).

### Fees
This is obvious, banks are loaded with fees. A fee to have the luxury of even having a bank account open, an overdraft fee if your balance falls below $0, a fee to send my own money; the list goes on...

### Financial Inclusion
Many banking products, rates, payment options are set aside for a special group of people, thus leaving the majority of individuals stuck to the unfavorable banking standards.

### Security Issues
Centralized banking systems are proprietary software, you have to put 100% trust that the people responsible for the source code have discovered all security vulnerabilities before a malicious entity finds the vulnerability and takes advantages of the bank's customers and/or their personal data.

### Transaction Time
If you send an international payment right now, it will take multiple days to get to its destination. This is an archaic system.
<br/>
# Bitcoin Fixes This
### Accessibility
The Bitcoin network never sleeps. You can send/receive a transaction on ANY day at ANY time.

### Anonymity
You can be anonymous within the Bitcoin network as long as you participate carefully and responsibly. No government or central authority can easily track your activity; pseudo anonymity

### Control
There is no centrally controlled bank that is holding your money for you. The bitcoin is in your wallet, under your control.

### Decentralized
There is no central authority that oversees the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin at its core is a decentralized peer to peer monetary network that allows anyone in the entire world access to participate in the Bitcoin network.

### Uncensorable
Anyone, anywhere in the world, and at anytime can send a Bitcoin transaction. No bank or government in the entire world can stop a transaction from being sent/received.

<br/>
***Note: The items below are traits of bitcoin as long as you are holding your bitcoin in your OWN wallet/s. Centralized exchanges, can eliminate these aspects as the exchanges own the bitcoin for you and are only allowing you access to the wallet that is holding that bitcoin.***

# My Bitcoin Ventures
Over the past couple years, I've come to full appreciation of the Bitcoin network and realize the true possibilities that are in front of all us when using this life-altering technology.

If you want to be a sovereign individual, then you must use Bitcoin. Get away from these centralized banking systems and start taking back your financial control. When you give the banks control of your money, you're at their mercy.

I've been fully supporting the Bitcoin network using any available method as I find time to complete these projects. I'll run through my general Bitcoin setup, as of today, and the benefits of doing so...

## Hardware Wallets
To truly own Bitcoin, you have to hold it yourself. If your bitcoin is on an exchange then it's not yours because the exchange is the holder of the private key/s to access "your" bitcoin, they are simply allowing you access for the time being.

When you use your own hardware wallet you take back control of your private keys.

### My Hardware Wallets

***Note: The BitBox02 is my main wallet and is the only I would suggest***

  - [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/) Bitcoin Only edition.
  - [KeepKey](https://shapeshift.com/keepkey)
  - [Ledger Nano S/X](https://www.ledger.com/)
  - [SecuX V20](https://secuxtech.com/secux-v20-hardware-wallet/)
  - [Trezr](https://trezor.io/)

## Steel Wallets
In order to increase the resiliency of my crypto security, I always use a steel wallet to keep a backup of my wallet's [seed phrase](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phrase). I'll have my original seed phrase entry written in my [Shieldfolio](https://shieldfolio.com/) notebook and then I have a copy of that seed phrase stored in my steel wallet.

With the financial freedom that Bitcoin provides, it also requires new responsibilities like setting up your own disaster plan for securely storing you wallet's seed phrase. Steel wallets are the only viable option when trying to secure your Bitcoin from a serious disaster situation; such as a home fire, flood, etc. and should be utilized by ALL Bitcoin owners.

## Running Bitcoin Nodes

### Why run a node?
  When you run a Bitcoin node, you help:
  - Strengthen the network by providing your resources to validate every transaction before it gets added to the Bitcoin blockchain, thus increasing the security of the network.
  - Monitor the network to ensure it remains in a healthy state, since your node is constantly validating it will ensure the Bitcoin network has not been manipulated in any way.
  - Increase your own privacy since you can connect your wallet to your own node, you don't have to put your trust in someone else's node when sending/receiving transactions that may compromise your personal information.

**"NOT YOUR NODE, NOT YOUR RULES"**

### Bitcoin Node Devices
  To help support the Bitcoin network and verify transactions, these are my current node devices:

  ***Note: Each of these devices deserves a post, so I won't dive into details here about setup, usage, etc. just know that each of these is running a Bitcoin node ([Full Nodes](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node) & [Pruned Nodes](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/que-es-un-nodo-podado/)).***

  - [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/)

## Running Bitcoin miner:

### Why run a miner?

  Earn non-[KYC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp) bitcoin.

### Miner Setups

  - Running gpu miner using my gaming computer with [NiceHash QuickMiner](https://www.nicehash.com/quick-miner)
    ![GPU Miner](/img/Bitcoin/gpuminer.jpg)

  - I've ordered 2 [Bitmain Antminer S9J](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-s9j-14-5th) cause they're super cheap, obviously I know it's not going to be profitable, as they have became under powered over the years due to the natural advancement of technology, but overall that's not my end goal. My goal is to acquire as much non-KYC bitcoin as I can, so getting these [ASIC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asic.asp) miners for this price is worth it for my situation; well under $500 with the **P**ower **S**upply **U**nit so I was happy in the end.

<br/>

# Wrapping Up
Bitcoin changed me, I can't un-see what I've already seen, I can't unread what I've already read. Banks will never look the same. Government will never look the same. Money is freedom, but it's also a control mechanism; let them control the money and they will control you.

<h3>Bitcoin: fix the money, fix the world</h3>

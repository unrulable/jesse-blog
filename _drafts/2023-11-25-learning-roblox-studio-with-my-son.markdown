As a father, I'm always looking for ways to bond with my kids. My son and I should spend more time together and I struggle to think of ways to spend time with him doing activities that will keep both of our attentions. My son loves playing Roblox and as of the past year he's been slowly building his own games using Roblox Studio too. 

At times he asks me for help and I do my best to figure it out but there are tasks he asks about that are way above my technical understanding of Roblox Studio at this point. Luckily , I'm a software engineer so  I know I have the ability to learn the IDE and Lua language that Roblox Scripting uses, so this pose is going to be my attempt at **DEDICATING THE TIME** to learn Roblox Studio and develop industry level Roblox Studio skills while at the same time bonding and building with my son.

# Development Setup
I need the environment to do this so let's do this!

1. Go to the Roblox Create page to download the [Roblox Studio IDE](https://create.roblox.com/landing)
    a. Click on the Start Creating button to download the IDE

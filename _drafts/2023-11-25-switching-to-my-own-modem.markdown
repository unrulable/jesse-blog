Right now, I'm renting a modem, I know how stupid? That's why in this post I'm going to delve into my choice for my own modem and the decision making that took place along the way.

<br/>

# Why Use Own Modem?
## Cost
I'm paying $10 per month for renting a modem, which is $120 per year. This makes zero sense, as I could just purchase a high quality modem for about $150 and then I own it for the duration of its life, no extra charges.

## Efficiency
When choosing your own modem, you'll be able to ensure that your modem can scale with your internet usage and needs. With the ISP giving you a modem, you are limited to the hardware they THINK is the best for their customers, but this most likely is favored towards "cost efficiency" so if you are wanting to get the most technically out of your modem it's best to choose this yourself.

## Configuration
This will allow for unique configuration for multiple user setups etc.

## VPN
I want to implement an over-arching VPN approach for my home. Right now, I'm adding VPNs to each device but this is NOT a good approach due to device limitations per VPN account. Instead, I am going to implement the VPN at the base level directly into the Router, that way any and all connections to the router will be using the VPN.

# Which Modem to Choose?


# Modem Setup
1. Plug in new modem
2. Navigate to [spectrum.net/selfinstall](spectrum.net/selfinstall)
    a. You may be redirected to activate.spectrum.net. 


# Router Setup
I'm using an Asus gaming style router, the AC5300, so in order to swap out my Spectrum Router, I need to complete the Asus setup.

I used the Asus app to complete this, open the asus app and walk through setting up of your Asus router. It's extremelt straight forward and overall will hand hold you through the process.

*Note: You can also use a LAN cable to directly connect from the router to your computer and then navigate to router.asus.com to complete the setup.*

# Configurations (VPN, etc.)
1. MerlinWRT
2. VPN

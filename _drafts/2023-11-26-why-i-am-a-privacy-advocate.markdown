Right now, I'm renting a modem, I know how stupid? That's why in this post I'm going to delve into my choice for my own modem and the decision making that took place along the way.

# The Noob Argument
I hear this time and time again. My wife just yesterday said to me, "I have nothing secret I'm hiding or nothing illegal I'm doing". If everyone had this sentiment then by default you have a 100% willing/compliant population for a potential totalitarian / surveillance state.

The question is not what do I care since I have nothing to hide. The question is why would you ***willingly*** expose your life to the outside world when you have **ZERO** idea who is watching?

# Read the Cypherpunk Manifesto
Technology enables us but also can enslave us if we are not responsible. Privacy is a right that we must enshrine and hold dear because the state and governments in general will only use the technology to route the bewildered herd for their own benefit.
